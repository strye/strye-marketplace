# Summary Agent

The Summary Agent automatically generates daily intelligence summaries from collected research content across all domains, identifying trends, key insights, and topics of interest.

## Responsibilities

1. **Content Aggregation**: Gather articles from all domains added since the last summary
2. **Trend Analysis**: Identify emerging patterns and recurring topics across articles
3. **Key Insights Extraction**: Pull out significant findings, breakthroughs, and important developments
4. **Summary Generation**: Create a coherent, well-organized daily summary
5. **Archival**: Store daily summaries with timestamps for historical reference
6. **Scheduling**: Run on configured schedule (default: 09:00 AM daily)

## Summary Generation Process

### 1. Content Collection Phase
- Read configuration for daily summary settings
- Identify articles added since last summary
- Organize articles by domain and topic
- Filter for relevance and quality

### 2. Analysis Phase
- **Cross-domain Pattern Detection**: Find topics appearing in multiple domains
- **Trend Identification**: Identify what's trending up/down in mentions
- **Source Diversity Check**: Ensure insights aren't from single source
- **Relevance Scoring**: Rank articles by relevance and importance

### 3. Insights Extraction Phase
- Extract key findings from top articles
- Identify quotes and important data points
- Categorize insights by type: breakthrough, trend, warning, opportunity
- Link related insights across domains

### 4. Summary Composition Phase
- Create structured daily summary document
- Include executive summary (key points)
- Organize by domain with highlights
- Add cross-domain insights section
- Include statistical overview

## Summary Structure

Daily summaries are generated as markdown files named by date: `2024-01-15-summary.md`

- **MARKET**: Business or market-related news

## Cross-Domain Intelligence

The agent identifies connections between domains:

- Shared topics appearing in multiple domains
- Technologies from one domain enabling advances in another
- Policy impacts across sectors
- Emerging fields intersecting multiple domains

## Performance & Output

### Execution
- Runs asynchronously on schedule
- Can also be triggered manually: `/forecast.summary`
- Non-blocking (doesn't interfere with research activities)

### Output Quality
- Summaries range from 2-5 pages depending on article volume
- Always includes actionable insights
- Links back to source articles for verification
- Timestamps included for historical tracking

### Storage
- Saved to: `./forecast-research-content/daily-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-summary.md`
- Archived indefinitely
- Queryable by date range

## Configuration Options

From `config/config.json`:

```json
"summary": {
  "generateDailyAt": "09:00",           // Time to run
  "includeTopicsSummary": true,         // Add topics section
  "includeKeyInsights": true,           // Extract insights
  "includeStatistics": true,            // Add metrics table
  "outputDirectory": "./forecast-research-content/daily-summaries",
  "minArticlesPerDomain": 5,            // Skip domains with < 5 new articles
  "focusOnBreakthroughs": false,        // Weight breakthroughs higher
  "maxSummaryLength": "5000"            // Target word count
}
```

## Integration

**Triggered by:**
- Scheduled execution based on config
- `/forecast.summary` manual command (when implemented)

**Reads from:**
- All domain directories in `./forecast-research-content/`
- Article frontmatter and content

**Writes to:**
- `./forecast-research-content/daily-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-summary.md`
- Summary index for querying

**Dependencies:**
- Research Agent must have collected content
- config/config.json for scheduling and preferences
